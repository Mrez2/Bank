Welcome to the **Bank Data Analysis** project! This repository contains a complete data science pipeline using Python and Jupyter Notebook to explore, visualize, and analyze customer data from a banking dataset.

---

## 📘 Description

The goal of this project is to extract insights from banking data that can help improve decision-making, customer targeting, and strategic planning. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques, the notebook dives into trends and customer behavior patterns.

---

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools Used

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook (`bank.ipynb`)
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` – data manipulation
  - `numpy` – numerical operations
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` – machine learning
  - (Add more if used: `xgboost`, `lightgbm`, etc.)

---

## 📊 Project Goals

- Import and clean the bank dataset
- Perform detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize key patterns, correlations, and trends
- Train and evaluate predictive models (e.g. logistic regression, decision tree)
- Provide actionable insights and conclusions

---

## 🧪 Sample Analysis Performed

- Distribution of customer features (age, job, balance, etc.)
- Correlation between features
- Conversion rates by education, marital status, and contact method
- Feature importance in prediction
- Classification performance metrics

> ✅ *All analysis is reproducible in the `bank.ipynb` notebook.*
